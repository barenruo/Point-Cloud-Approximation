This repo contains a special approximation methods for point clouds;
Please run ba.m and my3d.m to see the approximation process;
This method is base on local LS approximation, but not using LS directly;
Because if we connect local area using constrains, it will result in a large Normal matrix and cause singularity;
we use the basis function of plan surface to avoid large calculation when connecting neighboring area;
